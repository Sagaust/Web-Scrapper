Nigerian Professional Football League Teams continue poor continental performance as di 2 teams wey bin remain for CAF Champions league don relegate and Kwara United don comot from CAF Confederations Cup

To most Nigerian football fans, dis loses no go come as shocker because over di years, Nigerian teams no dey really show doings for inside continent.

Although di 3 teams bin travel for return leg with home win, the north african teams wey dem play against bin make very good use of home advantage and away goal rule.

For di match wey end 1-0 in favour of ES Tunis, Plateau United go feel like say di referee run dem street sake of say di penalty wey eim award suppose be freekick as di contact bin come just outside di box.

Rivers United, di champions of Nigeria collect wotowoto for di match wey end 6-0 in favour of di African Champions Wydad.

Kwara United wey win Berkane 3-1 for Lagos, bin lose for Morocco 2-0 as Berkane qualify with away goal rule.

If Nigeria go still carry any continental trophy dis season, then na either Rivers United or Plateau United go do am as dem don relegate go CAF Confederations Cup.
