Dis fit be true, sake of say Moscow fit dey fear say Ukrainian forces fit use di road over di dam to get troops across di river into Russian-held territory, as part of a counter-offensive.


But Kremlintok-tok pesin Dmitry Peskov no agree say Russian get hand inside, and instead dem blame Ukraine, as dem call am an act of "sabotage" wey go deprive di Crimean peninsula - di area wey Russia cut comot from Ukraine in 2014 - of water.

But as e be so, di dam na a vital channel wey dey carry water from Dnipro to Russian-occupied Crimea, wey mean say water supplies for dia dey likely to dey affected.


Afta Russia cut Crimea comot in 2014, Ukraine block one channel wey dey carry water from Nova Kakhovka. E cause water crisis for di  peninsula.


Russian forces reopened di channel afta di full scale invasion last year. But without di dam, dropping water levels fit jeopardise di flow of water along di channel again.


Russia don previously carry out several attacks on dams throughout Ukraine since di invasion, wey dey cause widespread flooding and disrupting power supplies.
