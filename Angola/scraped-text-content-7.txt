Ruy Duarte de Carvalho

Alternate names: Ruy Alberto Duarte Gomes de Carvalho

Biography

Ruy Duarte de Carvalho was born 1941 in Santarém, Portugal and grew up in Namibe, south of Angola. His writings captured experiences of the Kuvale people of southern Angola, including their nomadic pastoral way of life and traditions. Poet, film director, and anthropologist, he was actively involved in Angola’s freedom fight. He received his diploma and doctorate from the School of High Studies in Social Sciences, Paris in 1982 and 1986 respectively. Considered one of Angola’s most prestigious poets, he devoted himself to the study of photography and traditional oral poetry. He taught at Luanda, Coimbra, Sao Paulo, Paris and Berkely until he moved to Swakopmund, Namibia where he died in 2010.
