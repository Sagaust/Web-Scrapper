Amina Bakouri

Biography

Amina Bakouri was born in 1969 in Taza, Morocco. She is most well known for writing contemporary women’s poetry through the lens of the Arab tradition where she challenges patriarchal authority. Her poetry collection, Ra'ian Ya'tika Lmadih, was published in 2002. She received her Ph.D. in Arab literature from the Faculty of letters, Rabat, Morocco. In her work, the poet makes references to the Arabic poetic heritage, and her writing style has been described as embodying a spiritual aura. Like other contemporary Moroccan female writers, Bakouri uses complex interrelationships between different texts as a guide to literary interpretation, an approach that is largely connected to Morocco’s past poetic memory.
