Biography

Atukwei Okai was born in 1941 in Accra, Ghana. His first collection of poems, Flowerfall, was published in June 1969. His other collections include Oath of the Fontonfrom and Other Poems (1971), Lorgorligi: Logarithms and Other Poems (1974), Freedom Symphony: Selected and New Love Poems (2008) and Mandela the Spear and Other Poems (2013). Okai’s poems have been translated into several languages and anthologized over the years. Rooted in oral tradition, his writings have been recognized as having Pan-Africanist vision.

He later received his M.Phil from the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London in 1971. He was Secretary-General of the Pan African Writers' Association in 1989.
