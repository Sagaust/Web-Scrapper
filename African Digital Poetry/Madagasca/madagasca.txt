Biography

Esther Nirina was born in 1932 on the central highlands of Madagascar. From 1953 to 1983, she lived and worked as a librarian at Orléans, France. She is the author of several poetry collections including Lente spirale (Spiral Lens) (1990), Multiple solitude (1997), Rien que lune : Oeuvres poétiques (Nothing but the Moon: Poetic Works) (1998), among others. Her second volume of poetry, Simple voyelle, was awarded the ADELF Grand Prix Littérature de Madagascar. In her writings, she focuses on themes of unity, creation, and after joining the group, "Les Amis de Rochefort," she learned about surrealism, which influenced her style of writing.
