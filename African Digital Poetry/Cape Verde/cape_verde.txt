Corsino António Fortes

Biography

Corsino António Fortes was born 1933 in Mindelo, Cape Verde. Poet and diplomat, he is known to explore his country’s independence and path to liberation in his writings, as well as themes of exile, oppression and identity. His first book, Pão & Fonema (1974), addressed the conditions of island populations under Portuguese rule where Cape Verdeans suffered from hunger. The poet engages the political and cultural aspects of the Cape Verdean life and captures the islands' distinctive African nature. Fortes served as the first Ambassador of Cape Verde to Portugal from 1975 until 1981. He was the president of the Association of Cape Verde Writers (2003-2006) and the founder of Cape Verdean Academy of Letters. He studied Law at the University of Lisbon in 1966 and worked as a professor and judge of the Labour Court.
