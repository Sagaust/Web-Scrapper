Peter Horn

Alternate names: Rudolf Gisela

Biography

Peter Horn was born 1934 in Teplice, Czech. He is most well known for his anti-Apartheid poetry, which caused him to face disciplinary hearings and threats of deportation. His work envisions a multiracial society, advocates for freedom, and captures the experiences of the oppressed. He went to the University of Witwatersrand where he pursued a doctorate in German Studies (1970). In 2000, he was a Finalist for the Caine Prize for African Literature. He was the recipient of the 2011 SALA Literary Lifetime Award for his contribution to literature in South Africa. In 1974, Horn joined the staff at the University of Cape Town (UCT) and was made an Honorary Lifetime Fellow at UCT in 1994. He died in 2019 in Johannesburg.
