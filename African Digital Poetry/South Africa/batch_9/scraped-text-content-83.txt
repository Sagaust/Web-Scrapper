He went to university of Cape Town where he studied Philosophy and Painting. In 2017, he was selected as Laureate of the Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award. Breytenbach is well known for his political activism, especially his active involvement in the anti-apartheid movement in the 1960s and 1970s. Following his increased radicalization, he was arrested, charged with terrorism, convicted, and in November 1975 received a nine-year sentence until he was summarily freed in December 1982 and he moved to Paris, where he lives with his wife.
