Mbella Sonne Dipoko

Biography

Mbella Sonne Dipoko was born in 1936 in Douala, Cameroon. He is the author of the poetry collection Black and White in Love (1972). His literary portfolio consists of writings grounded in militant ideals as well as overt sexuality; the latter has received both praise and criticism for its eroticism. A poet and novelist, he went to University of Paris for his studies in Law and Economics, but decided to pursue writing full time. Considered one of the foremost writers of Anglophone Cameroonian literature, Dipoko’s work has been widely anthologized. He returned from the West in 1985 and in 1991 and was enthroned as the chief of Misaka, a position previously held by his late father. He died in 2009 in Tiko, Cameroon.
