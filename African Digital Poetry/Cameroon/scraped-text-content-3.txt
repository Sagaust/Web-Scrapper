Biography

Juliana Makuchi Nfah-Abbenyi was born in 1958 in the South-West Province of Cameroon and raised in North West Province. Writer and critic, she is the author of Our Madness, Not Mine: Stories of Cameroon (1999), The Sacred Door and Other Stories: Cameroon Folktales of the Beba (2008), among others.

She received her B.A. in Bilingual Letters, English & French and MA in African Literature from the University of Yaounde. She also holds a doctorate in Comparative Literature from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, after which she immigrated to the United States.
